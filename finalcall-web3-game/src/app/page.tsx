              <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold">1. Dynamic Prize Pool</h3>
              <p>Progressive Rewards: Build a prize pool that grows dynamically with each new bet. The more bets are placed, the bigger the prize, which can make it exciting to stay in the game longer.</p>
              <p>Winner Takes All vs. Split Rewards: Instead of just one winner, create tiers of rewards‚Äîe.g., a grand prize for the last person, but smaller rewards for participants who stayed in the longest. This could entice more users to stay involved.</p>

            <div className="space-y-2">
              <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold">2. Countdown Visuals & Alerts</h3>
              <p>Visual Countdown Timer: A prominently displayed countdown timer that shows when the one-minute limit is about to expire can create suspense.</p>
              <p>Real-time Notifications: Give users the option to receive real-time push notifications if the timer is nearing the end, prompting them to place a bet.</p>

            <div className="space-y-2">
              <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold">3. Leaderboards and Player Profiles</h3>
              <p>Leaderboard with Rank and Stats: Track players based on their wins, time in-game, and biggest bets, and display their ranks. High scores or leaderboards add an element of status and encourage repeat play.</p>
              <p>Profile Customization & NFT Avatars: Allow players to use customizable avatars or NFT assets as their in-game persona, boosting their attachment to the game.</p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold">4. Special Power-ups and Bonuses</h3>
              <p>Shield or Block Options: Offer items that can freeze the timer briefly or prevent others from betting for a short period. Players could use these strategically, making the game more competitive.</p>
              <p>Bonus Bets or Double-Or-Nothing Rounds: Let players use boosts to double their winnings or gain an advantage in the bidding rounds, adding layers of strategy.</p>

              <p>Chat and Emotes: A chat feature with emotes or reactions could make the game social and fun. Reactions like ‚Äúüî•‚Äù for big bets or ‚Äú‚è≥‚Äù when the timer is near zero could enhance engagement.</p>

            <div className="space-y-2">
              <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold">6. Exclusive and Limited-Edition NFTs</h3>
              <p>Reward NFTs for Winners: Offer unique NFTs that can only be won by being the last bettor in a particular season. These NFTs could confer bragging rights or in-game benefits in future rounds.</p>
              <p>In-Game NFT Drops: Occasionally drop NFTs with in-game perks, like a small shield or timer booster, only available for those actively participating.</p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold">7. Variable Betting Challenges</h3>
              <p>Timed Events with High Stakes: Introduce special rounds where the game is faster-paced, or the required waiting time is reduced to 30 seconds. These rounds could have a higher prize pool.</p>
              <p>Limited-Time Themes: Change the theme or betting conditions every week, like a themed tournament with bonus perks or multipliers for certain kinds of bets.</p>
